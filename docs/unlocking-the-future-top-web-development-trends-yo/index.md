## 2. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

### What are Progressive Web Apps?
Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web applications that leverage modern web capabilities to provide a user experience similar to native mobile apps. PWAs are fast, reliable, and engaging, offering features like offline support, push notifications, and home screen installation.

### Why are PWAs Trending?

- They are cost-effective to develop and maintain compared to native apps.
- PWAs can significantly improve performance and user retention rates.

### Actionable Advice:

## 3. Single Page Applications (SPAs)

### What are Single Page Applications?
Single Page Applications (SPAs) are web applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update the content as the user interacts with the app. SPAs provide a smooth and responsive user experience by avoiding full page reloads.

### Why are SPAs Popular?
- SPAs offer faster navigation and improved performance by loading only required data.
- They provide a more app-like experience, enhancing user engagement.
- SPAs can be built using frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.
