## Understanding Mobile App Development

Mobile app development involves the process of creating software applications that run on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. There are two main platforms for mobile app development:

### 1. Native App Development

Native app development involves creating applications for specific platforms such as iOS or Android using platform-specific programming languages and tools. Some popular programming languages for native app development include:

- **iOS**: Swift, Objective-C
- **Android**: Java, Kotlin

### 2. Cross-Platform App Development

Cross-platform app development allows developers to build applications that can run on multiple platforms using a single codebase. Some popular cross-platform frameworks include:

- **React Native**: Uses JavaScript and React to build native-like apps for iOS and Android.
- **Flutter**: Developed by Google, uses Dart language to build high-performance apps for multiple platforms.
