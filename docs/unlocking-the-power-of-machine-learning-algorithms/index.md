## Introduction to Machine Learning Algorithms

Machine learning algorithms enable computers to learn patterns from data and make informed decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed. They are broadly categorized into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

### Why Are ML Algorithms Important?

- **Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks and decision-making processes.
- **Insights:** Extract valuable insights from large datasets.
- **Personalization:** Deliver tailored experiences (e.g., recommendations).
- **Efficiency:** Optimize operations and resource allocation.

### 1. Supervised Learning Algorithms

Supervised learning algorithms are trained on labeled datasets, meaning each training example has an associated output.

#### Common Algorithms:
- **Linear Regression**  
  - Used for continuous output prediction, e.g., house prices.
  - *Example:* Predicting sales based on advertising spend.
- **Logistic Regression**  
  - Used for binary classification tasks, e.g., spam detection.
- **Decision Trees**  
  - Intuitive models that split data based on feature thresholds.
- **Random Forests**  
  - Ensemble of decision trees, reducing overfitting.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**  
  - Effective in high-dimensional spaces; good for classification tasks.
- **Neural Networks**  
  - Suitable for complex problems like image recognition.

#### Practical Example:
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Predict house prices based on size
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

### 2. Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

Unsupervised algorithms find hidden patterns in unlabeled data.

#### Common Algorithms:
- **Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering)**  
  Group similar data points, e.g., customer segmentation.
- **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE)**  
  Reduce feature space for visualization or noise reduction.
- **Association Rule Learning (Apriori, Eclat)**  
  Discover relationships between variables, e.g., market basket analysis.

#### Practical Example:
```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Segment customers into 3 groups
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(customer_data)
```

### 3. Semi-supervised and Reinforcement Learning

- **Semi-supervised learning** uses a small amount of labeled data with a large unlabeled dataset.
- **Reinforcement learning (RL)** involves agents learning to make decisions through rewards and penalties, suitable for robotics, gaming, etc.

## Practical Examples and Code Snippets

### Example: Building a Random Forest Classifier

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load dataset
X, y = load_dataset()  # Replace with your data loading method

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train model
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred):.2f}')
```

### Example: Hyperparameter Tuning with Grid Search

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],
    'max_depth': [None, 10, 20],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10]
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=clf, param_grid=param_grid, cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(f'Best parameters: {grid_search.best_params_}')
```
