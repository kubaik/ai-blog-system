## Understanding Data Science Techniques

Data science techniques encompass a wide range of methodologies and tools used to analyze and interpret data. Here are some key techniques commonly used in data science:

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

- Removing missing values
- Handling outliers
- Normalizing data
- Encoding categorical variables

Example:
```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
data.dropna(inplace=True)
```

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Descriptive statistics
- Data visualization
- Correlation analysis
- Dimensionality reduction

Example:
```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.pairplot(data)
```

### 3. Machine Learning Algorithms

- Supervised learning (e.g., regression, classification)
- Unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- Reinforcement learning
- Deep learning
