## Core Data Science Techniques

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Data is often messy. Cleaning it effectively is fundamental to accurate analysis.

**Practical Tips:**
- **Handling Missing Data:**
  - Use `pandas` functions like `fillna()` or `dropna()`.
  - Example:
    ```python
    df['column'].fillna(df['column'].mean(), inplace=True)
    ```
- **Detecting Outliers:**
  - Use boxplots or z-score methods.
  - Z-score example:
    ```python
    from scipy import stats
    import numpy as np
    
    z_scores = np.abs(stats.zscore(df['column']))
    df = df[z_scores < 3]
    ```
- **Encoding Categorical Variables:**
  - Use one-hot encoding or label encoding.
  - Example:
    ```python
    df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['category'])
    ```

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA helps you understand data distributions, relationships, and anomalies.

**Key Techniques:**
- **Visualization:**
  - Histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps.
  - Example:
    ```python
    import seaborn as sns
    sns.scatterplot(x='feature1', y='feature2', data=df)
    ```
- **Correlation Analysis:**
  - Use `corr()` to identify relationships.
    ```python
    correlation_matrix = df.corr()
    sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True)
    ```

### 3. Feature Engineering

Creating meaningful features can significantly boost model performance.

**Strategies:**
- **Polynomial Features:**
  - Capture non-linear relationships.
  - Example:
    ```python
    from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
    poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)
    X_poly = poly.fit_transform(X)
    ```
- **Interaction Terms:**
  - Combine features to capture interactions.
- **Datetime Features:**
  - Extract day, month, weekday, etc.
  - Example:
    ```python
    df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])
    df['month'] = df['date'].dt.month
    df['weekday'] = df['date'].dt.weekday
    ```

### 4. Model Selection & Training

Choosing the right model is crucial. Popular algorithms include:

- **Linear Regression** for continuous outcomes.
- **Logistic Regression** for binary classification.
- **Decision Trees & Random Forests** for complex, non-linear data.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** for high-dimensional data.
- **Neural Networks** for deep learning tasks.

**Example: Training a Random Forest Classifier**
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### 5. Model Evaluation & Validation

Assess your model to prevent overfitting and ensure generalization.

**Common Metrics:**
- **Classification:**
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
- **Regression:**
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared.

**Example: Evaluating a Classifier**
```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

**Cross-Validation:**
- Use `cross_val_score()` to validate models.
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')
print('Average Accuracy:', scores.mean())
```

## Advanced Techniques to Boost Your Skills

### 1. Ensemble Methods

Combine multiple models to improve accuracy.

- **Bagging:** Random Forests.
- **Boosting:** Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM.
- **Stacking:** Combining different model types.

**Practical Advice:**
- Use libraries like `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `LightGBM`.
- Example with XGBoost:
```python
import xgboost as xgb

model = xgb.XGBClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1)

model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### 2. Dimensionality Reduction

Reduce feature space to improve model efficiency.

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
  ```python
  from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
  pca = PCA(n_components=2)
  X_reduced = pca.fit_transform(X)
  ```
- **t-SNE:**
  Useful for visualization in 2D/3D.

### 3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

For textual data, techniques include:

- **Tokenization & Text Cleaning:**
  - Remove stopwords, punctuation.
- **Vectorization:**
  - TF-IDF, CountVectorizer.
- **Embeddings:**
  - Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT.

*Example: Converting text to features with TF-IDF*
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X_text = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)
```

### 4. Time Series Analysis

For sequential data, techniques include:

- **Decomposition:** Trend, seasonality.
- **Forecasting Models:** ARIMA, Prophet.
- **Feature Creation:** Lag features, rolling means.

## Practical Example: End-to-End Workflow

Suppose youâ€™re working on predicting customer churn:

1. **Data Collection:** Gather customer data from CRM systems.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values and encode categorical features.
3. **EDA:** Visualize churn rates across demographics.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Create tenure and interaction features.
5. **Modeling:** Train a Random Forest classifier.
6. **Evaluation:** Use ROC-AUC to assess performance.
7. **Deployment:** Integrate the model into a web app for real-time predictions.

**Sample code snippet:**
```python
# Data Cleaning
df['income'].fillna(df['income'].median(), inplace=True)

# Feature Engineering
df['tenure_years'] = df['tenure_months'] / 12

# Model Training
X = df[['income', 'age', 'tenure_years']]
y = df['churn']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluation
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score
y_pred_proba = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]
print('ROC-AUC:', roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred_proba))
```
