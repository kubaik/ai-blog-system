## Core Data Science Techniques

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Poor quality data can sabotage your analysis. Effective data cleaning involves:

- **Handling Missing Data**:
  - Imputation using mean, median, or mode
  - Removing rows or columns with excessive missingness
- **Detecting Outliers**:
  - Using statistical methods like Z-score or IQR
- **Data Transformation**:
  - Normalization or standardization for consistent feature scales
  - Encoding categorical variables with techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding

**Practical Example:**

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

# Fill missing values
df['sales'].fillna(df['sales'].mean(), inplace=True)

# Detect outliers using Z-score
from scipy import stats
import numpy as np

z_scores = np.abs(stats.zscore(df['sales']))
df = df[z_scores < 3]

# Standardize features
scaler = StandardScaler()
df['sales_scaled'] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['sales']])
```

*Tip:* Automate data cleaning pipelines using tools like **Pandas** and **scikit-learn** to streamline preprocessing tasks.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA helps you uncover patterns, relationships, and anomalies in your data:

- **Visualizations**:
  - Histograms, box plots, scatter plots
- **Correlation Analysis**:
  - Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients
- **Summary Statistics**:
  - Mean, median, mode, variance

**Practical Example:**

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Histogram
sns.histplot(df['sales'], bins=30)
plt.title('Sales Distribution')
plt.show()

# Correlation heatmap
corr = df.corr()
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Feature Correlation')
plt.show()
```

*Tip:* Use libraries like **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for rich visualizations that reveal insights quickly.

### 3. Feature Engineering

Creating new features or transforming existing ones can significantly boost model performance:

- **Polynomial Features**:
  - Capture non-linear relationships
- **Interaction Terms**:
  - Combine features to model interactions
- **Datetime Features**:
  - Extract day, month, weekday, or holiday indicators
- **Text Features**:
  - Use TF-IDF or word embeddings for NLP tasks

**Practical Example:**

```python
# Extract date features
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])
df['month'] = df['date'].dt.month
df['day_of_week'] = df['date'].dt.dayofweek

# Create polynomial feature
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures

poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2, include_bias=False)
poly_features = poly.fit_transform(df[['sales_scaled']])
```

*Tip:* Use **FeatureTools** or **tsfresh** for automated feature engineering, especially with large datasets.

### 4. Model Selection and Training

Choosing the right model depends on your problem type:

- **Regression**: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Machines
- **Classification**: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks
- **Clustering**: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering

**Practical Example:**

```python

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Features and target
X = df[['sales_scaled', 'month', 'day_of_week']]
y = df['target_variable']

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
```

*Tip:* Use cross-validation (`GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV`) to tune hyperparameters for optimal model performance.

---

### 5. Model Evaluation and Validation

Assess your model’s effectiveness:

- **Regression Metrics**:
  - R-squared, RMSE, MAE
- **Classification Metrics**:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- **Residual Analysis**:
  - Check for patterns in residuals to identify model biases

**Practical Example:**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score, mean_absolute_error

# Calculate metrics
r2 = r2_score(y_test, predictions)
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)

print(f"R-squared: {r2}")
print(f"MAE: {mae}")
```

*Tip:* Always validate your models on unseen data to prevent overfitting, and consider using techniques like **k-fold cross-validation** for robust evaluation.

## Advanced Techniques for Data Scientists

### 1. Ensemble Methods

Combining multiple models can lead to better performance:

- **Bagging** (e.g., Random Forest)
- **Boosting** (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
- **Stacking**: Combining different models

**Practical Advice:**

- Use ensemble methods when individual models have complementary strengths.
- Always validate ensemble performance against base models.

---

### 2. Dimensionality Reduction

When dealing with high-dimensional data, reduce complexity:

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **t-SNE**: For visualization
- **Autoencoders**: For deep learning applications

**Example:**

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

pca = PCA(n_components=2)
principal_components = pca.fit_transform(df.drop('target', axis=1))
```

*Tip:* Dimensionality reduction can improve model training time and help visualize data patterns.

---

### 3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Leverage NLP techniques for text data:

- Tokenization and cleaning
- Vectorization using TF-IDF or word embeddings
- Sentiment analysis

**Practical Example:**

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

texts = df['review_text']
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000)
X_text = vectorizer.fit_transform(texts)
```

*Tip:* Use libraries like **SpaCy** or **NLTK** for advanced NLP preprocessing.
