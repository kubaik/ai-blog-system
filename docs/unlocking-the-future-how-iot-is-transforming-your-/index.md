## What Is the Internet of Things (IoT)?

At its core, IoT refers to the network of interconnected physical devices embedded with sensors, software, and network connectivity, enabling them to collect and exchange data. These devices can range from everyday household gadgets to complex industrial machinery.

### Basic Components of IoT

- **Devices/Sensors:** Collect data from the physical environment (temperature, motion, humidity, etc.).
- **Connectivity:** Transmit data via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, Zigbee, or LPWAN protocols.
- **Data Processing:** Cloud or edge computing platforms process the data.
- **User Interface:** Dashboards, mobile apps, or APIs allow users to interact with and control devices.

### How IoT Works

1. **Data Collection:** Sensors gather real-time data.
2. **Data Transmission:** Data is sent through secure networks.
3. **Data Analysis:** Cloud or edge devices analyze data for insights.
4. **Action:** Automated responses or user notifications are triggered based on analysis.
