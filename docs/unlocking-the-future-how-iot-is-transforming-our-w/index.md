## What Is the Internet of Things (IoT)?

### Definition and Concept

The Internet of Things refers to the interconnected network of physical devices, vehicles, appliances, sensors, and other objects embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity. These devices collect and exchange data, enabling automation, remote monitoring, and smarter decision-making.

### Core Components of IoT

- **Devices/Sensors:** Collect data from the environment or the object itself.
- **Connectivity:** Facilitates data transmission via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LTE, 5G, or LPWAN protocols.
- **Data Processing:** Cloud computing or edge devices analyze the data.
- **User Interface:** Dashboards, apps, or alerts that allow users to interact with or control IoT devices.

### How IoT Works: A Simplified Workflow

1. **Data Collection:** Sensors gather information (e.g., temperature, motion, humidity).
2. **Data Transmission:** Devices send data over a network.
3. **Data Processing:** Cloud or local servers analyze data.
4. **Decision & Action:** Based on insights, actions are taken—either automatically or manually.
5. **Feedback Loop:** Continuous data collection refines system performance.
