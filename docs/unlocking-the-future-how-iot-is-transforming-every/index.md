## What Is IoT? A Brief Overview

The Internet of Things refers to the interconnected network of physical devices embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies that enable them to collect and exchange data over the internet. Unlike traditional devices, IoT objects are "smart," capable of autonomous operation and communication.

### Key Components of IoT

- **Devices/Sensors:** Collect data from the physical environment (e.g., temperature sensors, motion detectors).
- **Connectivity:** Wireless or wired communication protocols (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, 5G).
- **Data Processing:** Cloud platforms or local servers analyze the collected data.
- **User Interface:** Apps or dashboards that allow users to interact with IoT systems.

### How IoT Works in Practice

1. **Data Collection:** Sensors gather information (e.g., a smart thermostat detects room temperature).
2. **Data Transmission:** Data is sent via network protocols to cloud servers.
3. **Data Analysis:** Algorithms process data to identify patterns or triggers.
4. **Action or Notification:** Based on analysis, systems activate devices or notify users (e.g., adjusting temperature or sending alerts).
