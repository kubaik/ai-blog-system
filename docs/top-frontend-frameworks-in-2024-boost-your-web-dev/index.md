**Practical Example:**

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Counter: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
export default Counter;
```

- Small to medium projects
- Existing projects migrating to Vue 3
- Interactive dashboards

**Practical Example:**

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h2>Vue Counter: {{ count }}</h2>
    <button @click="increment">Increment</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { ref } from 'vue';

export default {
  setup() {
    const count = ref(0);
    const increment = () => {
      count.value++;
    };
    return { count, increment };
  }
};
</script>
```

**Actionable Tips:**
- Use Vue CLI or Vite for project scaffolding.
- Explore Vue Devtools for debugging.
- Leverage Vue's ecosystem, such as Vue Router and Vuex.

### 3. Angular

**Overview:**  
Angular, maintained by Google, offers a comprehensive framework with built-in solutions for routing, state management, and form handling.

**Key Features:**
- TypeScript-based development
- Two-way data binding
- Modular architecture with NgModules

**Use Cases:**
- Large-scale enterprise applications
- Complex dashboards
- Applications requiring robust structure

**Practical Example:**

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-counter',
  template: `
    <h2>Angular Counter: {{ count }}</h2>
    <button (click)="increment()">Increment</button>
  `
})
export class CounterComponent {
  count = 0;

  increment() {
    this.count++;
  }
}
```

**Actionable Tips:**
- Use Angular CLI for scaffolding.
- Follow Angular best practices for modularity.
- Take advantage of Angular Material for UI components.

### 4. Svelte

**Overview:**  
Svelte is gaining momentum due to its innovative approach of compiling components at build time, resulting in smaller and faster apps.

**Key Features:**
- No virtual DOM; direct DOM manipulation
- Simplified syntax
- Excellent performance

**Use Cases:**
- Rapid prototyping
- Performance-critical applications
- Small to medium projects

**Practical Example:**

```svelte
<script>
  let count = 0;
</script>

<h2>Svelte Counter: {count}</h2>
<button on:click={() => count++}>Increment</button>
```

**Actionable Tips:**
- Use SvelteKit for full-stack development.
- Explore Svelte's reactive declarations (`$:`).
- Optimize by preloading components as needed.

### 5. Solid.js

**Overview:**  
Solid.js is an emerging framework emphasizing fine-grained reactivity and high performance, making it suitable for complex UIs requiring minimal overhead.

**Key Features:**

  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Solid.js Counter: {count()}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count() + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
export default Counter;
```
