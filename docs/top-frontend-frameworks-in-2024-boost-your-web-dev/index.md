  const addTodo = () => {
    if (newTodo.trim()) {
      setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);
      setNewTodo('');
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Todo List</h1>
      <input
        value={newTodo}
        onChange={(e) => setNewTodo(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Enter new task"
      />
      <button onClick={addTodo}>Add</button>
      <ul>
        {todos.map((todo, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{todo}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default TodoApp;
```

### Actionable Tips

- **Leverage Next.js** for server-side rendering and static site generation.

  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';

const count = ref(0);

function increment() {
  count.value++;
}
</script>
```

### Actionable Tips

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class DataService {
  private data: string[] = [];

  addItem(item: string) {
    this.data.push(item);
  }

  getItems() {
    return this.data;
  }
}
```

### Actionable Tips

- **Utilize Angular CLI** for scaffolding and optimization.
- **Embrace Standalone Components** to reduce complexity.
