## What Is the Internet of Things (IoT)?

### Definition and Core Concepts

The Internet of Things refers to the network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software, network connectivity, and actuators that enable these objects to collect and exchange data. Unlike traditional internet-enabled devices that primarily serve as user endpoints, IoT devices are smart and autonomous, capable of making decisions or acting on data with minimal human intervention.

### Key Components of IoT

- **Devices/Sensors**: Hardware that collects data from the environment (temperature, motion, humidity, etc.).
- **Connectivity**: Communication protocols such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, LoRaWAN, or cellular networks that transmit data.
- **Data Processing**: Cloud or edge computing platforms that analyze and interpret data.
- **Actuators**: Components that perform actions based on processed data (e.g., turning on a fan).
- **User Interface**: Apps or dashboards that allow users to monitor and control IoT devices.

### How IoT Works

1. **Data Collection**: Sensors gather real-time data.
2. **Data Transmission**: Data is sent to a cloud platform or local gateway.
3. **Data Processing & Analysis**: Algorithms analyze data for patterns or anomalies.
4. **Decision & Action**: Based on analysis, devices perform actions or send alerts.
5. **User Interaction**: Users receive insights or control devices through apps.
